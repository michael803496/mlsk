        <h2>HEY ISRAEL</h2>
        <p> I hope this letter finds you well! It's been far too long since we last caught up, and I've been meaning to
            check in with you. I realized I have no idea how you've been lately, so I thought I'd drop you a quick note
            to ask how things are going on your end. How is Ewa cause it's been long since i spoke to her and jerry,
            help me greet them.</p>

        <p>Life has been a bit easy for me, honestly but I'm surviving! Work and school has been keeping me busy as
            usual, but nothing too out of the ordinary. I'm sure you can relate it's like the old days together
            sometimes, right? The good thing is, I've been trying to squeeze in some downtime here and there. I've
            recently gotten into insert a hobby, interest, or something you've been doing recently. and it's been
            a nice way to clear.</p>
        <P>Have you picked up anything new or exciting recently?

        I'm really curious to hear how things have been for you, though. How's school treating you? Any new
        projects or challenges you're diving into? I know you have been working on cyber-security, and I would love to
        hear how it is all going. Also, how is Grandma, I remember you mentioned that a trip event, last time
        we talked, how did that go?

        Honestly, it feels like life is moving at full speed, and sometimes it's hard to keep up with
        everything.</P> 
        <P>I've been trying to make more of an effort to reconnect with people I care about.
        And you are definitely on that list. It feels like no time has passed at all. We really need to plan
        something soon to hang out and catch up properly. What do you think?
        Oh, and by the way, I have been meaning to ask—have you been on any cool trips or gotten into any new
        things since we last talked? I swear, everyone seems to be traveling more these days, and it's making me
        a bit envious. I would love to hear about your adventures if you've had any!</P>

        <P>Things around here have been pretty good overall, just the usual routine. But I am doing my best to stay
        positive and take on the challenges as they come. I think sometimes it's easy to get bogged down in
        everything, so it's nice to take a step back and think about the good stuff too, you know? I'm sure
        you're handling things just as well, though.

        Well, I guess I have rambled enough! I'd really love to hear back from you when you have a minute. Let me
        know how you're doing—your updates always make my day. Take care of yourself, and let's make sure we
        don't let too much time go by before we catch up again.</P>

        Looking forward to hearing from you soon! Take care.
        </p>
